  2013:
    - name:   Gutiérrez, Carla
      image:  scholarships/2013-gutierrez.png
      school: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Freshmen)
      award:  <kbd>$1000</kbd> Mario Colón Rivadeneira Memorial Scholarship
      bio:    "Carla started college this fall at Virginia Tech. She graduated with a 4.195 grade point average from high school and was an active participant in her school and home communities with involvement in various honor societies, choir clubs and other community service activities. Although Carla is just beginning her college career, she already has a clear vision of the future she wants for herself; as an equine veterinarian she will work a six-day week with additional “on call” emergency responsibilities as needed. Carla believes that overcoming obstacles, achieving dreams, ability to set goals, time management, being able to prioritize and taking the first step towards whatever needs to be done are at the core of what it means to be a leader. Carla’s favorite perspective about life comes from the words of Robert Frost, “In three words I can sum up everything I’ve learned about life: it goes on.” At times, when she makes mistakes, she is hard on herself, so she tries to remember these words; she refuses to live in the past; hanging on things she could have done differently. Life does go on and she wants to go on with it."

    - name:   López, Griselda

She is in her first semester and the competition ratio was approximately 4:1, from 132 students who applied this year only 32 were accepted. Griselda is very proud of this accomplishment as well as being the second one in her family to receive a college degree. Quoting a paragraph from her leadership essay: “Sometimes you must step forward and step up to the plate and become a team leader in order to keep the team moving forward. In 2011 I had to make a big decision to move forward and continue my education. I quit my job that I loved and had perfected so that I could focus on my studies.” Besides studying and being a mother of three, she still makes time to give back to the community by volunteering with Mission of Mercy and Give Kids a Smile, both of which help low income families like the one that she comes from."

As a believer that community service has been a road to his own redemption, Mr. Gomez has logged over 500 hours of volunteer work with the Special Olympics. He feels he has gained just as much from his commitment to the Special Olympics as they have benefitted from his involvement. Faced with challenges and adversity at home when he was in the ninth grade, Mr. Gomez says he lost hope and resigned himself to being a high school dropout. He credits a high school teacher for rescuing him from certain failure when she recognized his potential. In part his desire to teach in a public school is motivated by his wish to give back to the community that has supported and encouraged him. In his own words, “I want to become the kind of man who is improved by adversity, not one who is limited by it."
